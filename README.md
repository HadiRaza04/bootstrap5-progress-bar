Some practice on Bootstrap5 progress bar like color, height, mark etc from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3school</a>.

1) A progress bar can be used to show how far a user is in a process.

2) To create a default progress bar, add a <b>.progress</a> class to a container element and add the <b>.progress-bar</b> class to its child element. Use the CSS width property to set the width of the progress bar.

3) The height of the progress bar is <b>1rem (usually 16px)</b> by default. Use the CSS height property to change it. Note that you must set the same height for the progress container and the progress bar.

4) By default, the progress bar is <b>blue (primary)</b>. Use any of the contextual background classes to change its color.

5) Use the <b>.progress-bar-striped<b> class to add stripes to the progress bars.
